## Rotated Sorted Array Search
Given a sorted array of integers A of size N and an integer B.
Array A is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. 
You are given a target value B to search. If found in the array, return its index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.


### Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 1000000
1 <= A[i] <= 1e9
```

### Example
###### Input
```
A = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3]
B = 4
```
###### Output
```
0
```
