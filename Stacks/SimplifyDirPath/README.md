### Simplify Directory Path
Given a string A representing an absolute path for a file (Unix-style).
Return the string A after simplifying the absolute path.

Note:
- Absolute path always begin with '/' ( root directory ).
- Path will not have whitespace characters.

## Example 
```
Input 1:
A = "/home/"
Output 1:
"/home"

Input 2:
A = "/a/./b/../../c/"
Output 2:
"/c"
```
