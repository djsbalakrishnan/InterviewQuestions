## Largest Continuous Sequence Zero Sum
Given an array A of N integers.
Find the largest continuous sequence in a array which sums to zero.

### Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 1e6
-1e7 <= A[i] <= 1e7
```

### Examples
###### Input
```
A = [1,2,-2,4,-4]
```
###### Output
```
[2,-2,4,-4]
```
###### Explanation
```
[2,-2,4,-4] is the longest sequence with total sum of zero.
