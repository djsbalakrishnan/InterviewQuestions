## Swap List Nodes in pairs
Given a linked list A, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
NOTE: Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed. 

### Constraints
```
1 <= size of linked list <= 1e6
```

### Examples
###### Input
```
 A = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
```
###### Output
```
 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3
```
###### Explanation
```
It is a complete binary tree.
```
