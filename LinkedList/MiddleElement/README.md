## Middle Element of Linked List
Given a linked list of integers. Find and return the middle element of the linked list.
NOTE: If there are N nodes in the linked list and N is even then return the (N/2 + 1)th element.

#### Constraints
`1 <= N <= 1e5`
`1 <= Node value <= 1e9`

#### Example Input
`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`

#### Example Output
`4`

#### Explanation
The middle element in even length linked list of length N is ((N/2) + 1)th element which is 4.
