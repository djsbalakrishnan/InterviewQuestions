## Level Order
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

### Constraints
```
 1 <= number of nodes <= 1e5
```

### Examples
###### Input
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
###### Output
```
 [
   [3],
   [9, 20],
   [15, 7]
 ]
```
###### Explanation
```
 Return the 2D array. Each row denotes the traversal of each level.
