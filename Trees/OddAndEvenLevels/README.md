## Odd and Even Levels
Given a binary tree of integers. Find the difference between the sum of nodes at odd level and sum of nodes at even level.
NOTE: Consider the level of root node as 1.

#### Constraints
```
1 <= number of nodes <= 1e5
0 <= node values <= 1e9
```

###### Example Input
```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
  /
 8 
```

###### Example Output
```
 10
```

######
```
 Sum of nodes at odd level = 23
 Sum of ndoes at even level = 13
```
