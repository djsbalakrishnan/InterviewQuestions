## Sum Binary Tree or Not
Given a root of binary tree A, determine if it is height-balanced.

A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.


### Constraints
```
1 <= size of tree <= 1e5
```

### Examples
###### Input
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```
###### Output
```
1
```
###### Explanation
```
It is a complete binary tree.
```
