## Diameter of a Tree
Given a Binary Tree A consisting of N integer nodes, you need to find the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a tree is the number of edges on the longest path between two nodes in the tree.

### Constraints
```
1 <= Number of nodes in binary tree <= 1e5
```

### Examples
###### Input
```
           1
         /   \
        2     3
       / \
      4   5
```
###### Output
```
 3
```

###### Explanation 
```
 Longest Path in the tree is 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 and the number of edges in this path is 3 so diameter is 3.
```
