## Least Common Ancestor
Find the lowest common ancestor in an unordered binary tree A given two values B and C in the tree.

Lowest common ancestor: the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes v and w in a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both v and w as descendants.

### Constraints
```
1 <= size of tree <= 1e5
1 <= B, C <= 1e9
```

### Examples
###### Input
```
      1
     /  \
    2    3
   / \
  4   5
B = 4
C = 5
```
###### Output
```
 2
