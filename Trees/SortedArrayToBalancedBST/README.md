## Sorted Array To Balanced BST
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height Balanced Binary Search Tree (BBST).
Balanced tree : a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

### Constraints
```
1 <= |Array| <= 1e5
```

### Examples
###### Input
```
 A : [1, 2, 3, 5, 10]                    
```
###### Output
```
      3
    /   \
   2     5
  /       \
 1         10
```
