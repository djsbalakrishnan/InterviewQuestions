## Next Pointer Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

#### Constraints
```
1 <= number of nodes <= 1e5
```

#### Example Input
```
        1
       /  \
      2    5
     / \  / \
    3  4  6  7
```

#### Example Output
```
         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 5 -> NULL
     / \  / \
    3->4->6->7 -> NULL
```
