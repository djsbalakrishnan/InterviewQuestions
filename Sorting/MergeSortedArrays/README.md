## Matrix Search
Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge them as one sorted array and return it as an output.

### Constraints
```
-10e10 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10e10
```

### Examples
###### Input
```
A = [4, 7, 9 ]
B = [2, 11, 19 ]
```
###### Output
```
[2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 19]
```
###### Input
```
A = [1]
B = [2]
```
###### Output
```
[1, 2]
```
