## Reversing Elements of Queue
Given an array of integers A and an integer B. We need to reverse the order of the first B elements of the array, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.

### Constraints
```
1 <= B <= length of the array <= 500000
1 <= A[i] <= 1e5
```

### Examples
```
Input 1: 
 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 B = 3
Output 1:
 [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]

Input 2:
 A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
 B = 2
Output 2: 
 [17, 5, 100, 11]
```
