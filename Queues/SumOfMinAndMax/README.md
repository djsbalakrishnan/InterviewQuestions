## Sum of min and max
Given an array A of both positive and negative integers.
Your task is to compute sum of minimum and maximum elements of all sub-array of size B.

NOTE: Since the answer can be very large, you are required to return the sum modulo 1e9 + 7.


### Constraints
```
1 <= |A| <= 1e5
-1e9 <= A[i] <= 1e9
1 <= B <= |A|
```

### Example
###### Input
```
 A = [2, 5, -1, 7, -3, -1, -2]
 B = 4
```
###### Output
```
 18
```
