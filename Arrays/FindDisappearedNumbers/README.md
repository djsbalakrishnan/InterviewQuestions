## Find Disappeared Numbers
Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

#### Constraints 
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= n
```

#### Example Input
```
nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
```


#### Example Output
```
[5,6]
```

#### Follow up
Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
