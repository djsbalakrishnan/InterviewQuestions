## Single Number
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

#### Constraints
```
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
```

#### Example Input
```
nums = [2,2,1]
```

#### Example Output
```
1
```
