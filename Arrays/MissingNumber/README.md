## Missing Number 
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

#### Constraints 
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 10^4
0 <= nums[i] <= n
```

#### Example Input
```nums = [3,0,1]```


#### Example Output
2


#### Explanation:
n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
